# CW00D-Evolution_Simulator
As part of my A level coursework I researched, planned and developed an evolution simulator based on work by John.H.Holland. The idea behind the project was to create a visual way of teaching students at school about evolution. To do this I used python as well as the sqlalchemy and pygame extensions to create a database and the UI respectively.
Futher information on the research, planning and development of the project in the pdf file of the project write up.
